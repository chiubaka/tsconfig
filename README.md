This package provides base TSConfig settings for projects in the Chiubaka Technologies ecosystem.


## Motivation
Ecosystem-wide standards help to ensure that we're maintaining consistent code quality and development
standards across all projects and all packages.

Also, setting these things up is annoying. Ideally, we have one place that centralizes the defaults the
org agrees on and then just keep that up-to-date.
